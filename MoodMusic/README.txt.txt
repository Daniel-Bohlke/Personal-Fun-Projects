This project was designed by myself for myself. The general idea was that I wanted to figure out how to play music with Java. 
So the purpose of this project was to create a music player using Javafx which would let you select a mood that you are feeling and play music accordingly! 
Currently the Player only plays one song per mood but I'm hoping in the future I can add more songs to the playlist! 
Otherwise this player is exactly what I imagined it would be and I'm really proud of it.
