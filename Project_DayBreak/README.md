This game started from the logic of what was mean to be another game. After my school project "Roads To Adventure" kind of tanked, I decided to start fresh, using Java2D for graphics.
(I know Java2D is old and sometimes inefficient) but I was going to have to do a lot of stuff I had never attempted before and there was a lot of online help for Java2D
I have decided to name this new Project "DayBreak" and again this is mostly for fun but I would hate to not give credit to those who deserved it.
So thank you to:
Jonathan Novak, BennetVanderVeer, and Rolf Anderson for helping to come up with the idea of "Roads To Adventure" which inspired this game.
Rosalie Dubberke for art for the items.
And to you! For checking out this game, currently it is still a work-in-progress but I hope to have it done and looking great as soon as possible!
